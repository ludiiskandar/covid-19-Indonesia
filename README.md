### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

1. What are the total numbers of cases, recoveries, and deaths?
2. Can we see the total cases, recoveries, and deaths broken down by province?
3. Is there a map visualization available to display the distribution of cases geographically?
4. Can we view a detailed table with all relevant data for further analysis?

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- made broader dataset, so the data can reflect more update situation.
- add the data subdistrict so we can pull more clearer area.

---
### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions
